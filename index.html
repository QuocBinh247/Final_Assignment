    <p><strong>Student 1:</strong> Nguyen Quoc Binh</p>
    <p>My name is Nguyen Quoc Binh (s3818140), I am an undergraduate student in the Robotics and Mechatronics major at RMIT University Vietnam. 
        I am enthusiastic about technologies such as computer science, automated systems, and artificial intelligence, which is the reason why I 
        selected this course since it offers knowledge in a wide range of technology areas. In addition, I also have prior experience with electrical design, 
        mechanical design, and embedded programming due to my work on several projects during the study period. My hobbies are traveling, reading, 
        watching movies (especially sci-fi and action movies), and playing video games in my free time.</p>
