    <h2>2. Personal Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Student 1:</strong> Nguyen Quoc Binh</p>
    <p>My name is Nguyen Quoc Binh (s3818140), I am an undergraduate student in the Robotics and Mechatronics major at RMIT University Vietnam. 
        I am enthusiastic about technologies such as computer science, automated systems, and artificial intelligence, which is the reason why I 
        selected this course since it offers knowledge in a wide range of technology areas. In addition, I also have prior experience with electrical design, 
        mechanical design, and embedded programming due to my work on several projects during the study period. My hobbies are traveling, reading, 
        watching movies (especially sci-fi and action movies), and playing video games in my free time.</p>

    <p><strong>Tran Manh Hung: Backend Developer (AI)</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Final statement:</strong></p>

    <!--Scope and Limits-->
    <h2>5. Scope and Limits</h2>
    <p>Here is the list of tasks that need to be done to complete our project:</p>
    <p>-	Make a database for storing the information of the customers (their age, weight and preference including their allergy to specific foods, vegetarian, etc.).</p>
    <p>-	Build a database that has various receipts with different values of calories.</p>
    <p>-	Create a feature allowing the user to input the names of ingredients by text.</p>
    <p>-	Scanning function that allows the customer to scan all the ingredients by using the camera on the phone.</p>
    <p>-	Train an AI model with the capability to recommend a suitable food portion based on user weight and a list of recommended receipts based on user preference (based on their ingredient and their frequency in the selection of food).</p>
    <p>-	The “Remind” feature will remind the customer about the leftover in the fridge when the user inputs the food and its due date.</p>
    <p>-	The “Switch User” feature allows the app to have many users on 1 smartphone.</p>
    <p>-	Build the User Interface (UI) for the application.</p>
    <p>-	Build an Android app and develop another version on the IOS platform (cross-platform development).</p>
    <p>-	Build the website.</p>
    <p>Based on the remaining time of this semester, the most important task is to finish building the website for the report and doing the presentation 
        for our project idea. About the app itself or any features, in our opinion, with the remaining time and the limited knowledge in programming applications 
        as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), we cannot build any functions of the application or the database as well as train the AI model. 
        If the time duration is extended, our team could work more on the project such as building the UI of the application and developing the algorithm to help 
        with the food recognition function to identify the ingredient in the picture. For the use of AI in the project, to reduce the budget and increase the performance
        of the app, instead of using AI to calculate the calories and recommend the receipts, we may build a database and use an algorithm to calculate the calories 
        and recommend the meal for the user.</p>
    
    <!--Tools and Technologies-->
    <h2>6. Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p><strong>Software:</strong></p>
    <p>-	C# for creating an application on the Android operating system-based devices.</p>
    <p>-	Xamarin allows for cross-platform application development on IOS [6, 7].</p>
    <p>-	The use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website to advertise the application and the website version of the app.</p>
    <p>-	Utilizing Google Colab to set up and train the AI model of the project [8].</p>
    <p>-	Using APIs to access database.</p>
    <p>-	Microsoft Word for the documentation of the project.</p>
    <p>-	Microsoft Team and Messenger for team meetings and communication.</p>
    <p>-	Microsoft PowerPoint for the demonstration of the project.</p>
    <p>-	Jupyter app for the notebook of the project [9].</p>
    <p>-	Trello is used to create a Gantt chart, which will control the timeline of the project [10].</p>
    <p>-	GitHub Desktop for storing and sharing the working file of the app [11].</p>
    <p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p>
    <p>-	Smartphones to test the website, the scanning ability of the application and other features (if available).</p>
    <p>-	Computers (or laptops) to test the accessibility of the website and access the website version of the app.</p>
    <p>-	Server to store the information of the customer and the database.</p>
    
    <!--Testing-->

    <!--Risks-->
    <h2>9. Risks</h2>
    
    <!--Group communications-->
    <h2>10. Group communications</h2>
    <p>Our team communicates daily through Messenger and weekly meetings will take place on Microsoft Team. If a member cannot be communicated with, 
        we will give that member 24 hours to provide a justified reason, which will be decided by the group leader based on the importance of the task 
        and its impact on the possible delay of the project. If the consequence is not serious, that member will be consulted and have an agreement on 
        the communication guidelines of the team. On the other hand, if the consequence is serious or the situation keeps happening many times, that member
         will be considered to have a negative contribution to the project and report to the management team (lecturer and course coordinator in this case).</p>
    
    <!--Skills and Jobs-->
    <h1>IV. Skills and Jobs</h1>
    <p>The followings are the required skillsets and position description in order to complete the project:</p>
    <p>- <strong>Position 1:</strong> Software Engineer, who has experience in working with programming languages such as Python, 
        doing projects related to image recognition, working with big data and developing the AI model to handle the database. 
        Additionally, the engineer has the responsibility of troubleshooting and upgrading the existing AI model.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Position 2:</strong> Software Engineer, who is familiar with working with AI models and integrating AI into the application. 
        Similar to the first position, the engineer has the responsibility of troubleshooting and upgrading the existing AI model.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Position 3:</strong> Full-stack Developer (Backend) having a skill set in app programming and in charge of maintaining servers. 
        Moreover, this position needs to maintain and debug the backend of the application.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Position 4:</strong> Full-stack Developer (Frontend) working with UI of the app (cross-platform for both IOS and Android) and the website. 
        This position also needs to work with the business partners (shareholders) of the project.</p>
    <p>All the mentioned positions are the most important skill sets that we need to finish our project. Besides all the mentioned skill sets, 
        every member of the team should have good communication skills, teamwork experience and problem-solving skills. Finally, all of them need to have 
        great time management skills, be able to adapt to the change in the working process and willing to learn about new things.</p>

    <!--Group Reflection-->
    <h1>V. Group Reflection</h1>
    <p><strong>Student 1:</strong> Nguyen Quoc Binh</p>
    <p>In my opinion, each member of our group has a good mindset in finishing their part on time. Moreover, they are also willing to rewrite their part to 
        meet the standard of the group if there is good advice from other members. Every member understands their responsibility while working as a team, 
        which allowed the team to work well with individual contributions in developing ideas, sharing group activities, helping other members, and having a 
        wide range of skillset in many areas. The only thing that our team needs to improve is the frequency of communication in the group. Every member should 
        be more active in sharing their opinions instead of waiting to be asked since the lack of communication leads to unexpected errors in writing reports and 
        misunderstandings about the expected outcomes of the project. As the most surprising thing, I have to say that the team performance is better than my 
        expectation since this is the first time we cooperate working on a project. Finally, one thing that I have learned about working as a group is to achieve 
        the best result, I need to have more trust in other teammates and every member needs to help each other and share their opinion to get a good teamwork experience.</p>
