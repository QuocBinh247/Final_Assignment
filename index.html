    <h2>3. Plan and Progress</h2>
    <p>Since food wastage is a widespread issue in many countries, particularly in Vietnam, managing food waste becomes a crucial problem.
        If success, it will result to increase our capacity to maintain our economy and environment and also help us have a healthy eating habit.
        Identifying that the problem needed appropriate measures to be solved, Binh - our team leader proposed a project to develop an application that allows
        users to reduce their food waste and manage their daily diet in a healthy way.In recent years, the mobile phone is an indispensable item for the majority
        of the population and Android is now used on millions of mobile devices in over 190 countries across the globe, making it the most widely used mobile platform [4].
        For that reason, we decided to develop an Android application using Android Studio in order to reach the majority of clients over the globe and will develop
        to cross-platform further in the future.</p>
    <p>In our proposed approach, this project will handle two issues which are food waste and unhealthy diets by helping people build a unique recipe for their meal.
        We want to develop a relevant application that can provide and share sustainable recipes which make such food products delicious and safe to eat. The app will
        have a function to suggest the appropriate meal for the user with calories for their consumption through the scanned ingredient. There are several key features
        that will offer great value for the clients. Firstly, we expect our app's onboarding process to be as smooth as possible. We expect our app can be used right
        away without any registration and will offer further advanced features for the user to register through their familiar account such as Facebook, Google, etc.
        Our application will use questionnaires to collect data such as weight, cooking habits and lifestyle then automatically save these entered data even if the
        user not doing the registration. By doing so, we can gather a lot of data for future development to improve our app performance. Secondly, we want to create
        a feature where the user can submit their custom goals. The app will ask what is the main purpose that the customers try to achieve besides the pre-defined
        options. There are several typical objectives such as maintaining a healthy weight, sticking to a strict diet. This data on the achievements of the existing 
        client will also be gathered for our product update afterward. </p>
    <p>The next feature which also is the core function of our app is nutrition data input. By integrating with extensive food databases and based on the information
        of user’s favorite and recent meals, the app has the ability to calculate the calories that need to be consumed and allow the user to access the nutritional
        information as well as the expiration date of the ingredient, suggest the user the suitable recipe or create their own custom. Besides, our team wants to
        develop a feature to scan the ingredients through the camera, however, this took a lot of effort and study on the vision algorithm to implement successfully.
        When the user put all the ingredients in one place and uses the app to scan at that location, the screen will appear the relevant information
        of these ingredients regarding names and calories. We plan to develop a feature with an AI model to track the user's daily calories intake, then suggest
        reasonable meals based on the user’s health condition like weight, disease, etc with the nutritional value of the recommended dish demonstrated
        in the picture below: </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img1.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Example of illustration of the dish. [5] "></p> 
        <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 3: Example of illustration of the dish. [5]</p>

    <P>Besides, we expect our app to include meal planning functionality which allows users to schedule meals using leftovers in the fridge before they expire.
         The user first will input relevant information about the remaining resources in their fridge then the app should be able to provide versatile recipes with ingredient
        breakdowns to enable preparing the food based on the scanned ingredient for example. This feature will not only assist the clients to have more sufficient diets but 
        also lead to minimizing food wastage as much as possible. In addition, sometimes, users won't remember to access the app frequently because of their work or busy
        schedule, therefore, a notification feature will be essential for our app to encourage and remind our customers to stick to the plan and update their data often. Since we want to
        deliver the best experience for the users, in order to avoid the annoying of unnecessary notifications our app will have a section in the setting where clients can fine-grained
        customization of various notifications' kinds.</P>
    <p>Our application requires an enormous number of databases such as web applications, nutrition and recipe databases. For our website application database, we want to connect our app
        to our website using MySQL to keep user data synchronized and accessible for other platforms. Regarding nutrition databases, it is a foundation of our application which provides it 
        with nutrition-related data namely calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Additionally, food databases make the program incredibly simple to use since the users do not need to
        input a lot of detailed information. The proposed application will use Nutritionix API since Nutritionix has a large validated nutrition database and provides several functionalities of the API suite. </p>
    <p> For our plan, we will conduct this project in 5 steps:</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Prototyping</strong></p>
    <p>This is the stage that we are capable of implementing as students. The interactive prototype is a click-through version of a product that only exists in design, without coding development.
        There are several benefits of prototyping, one is that we are able to test it utilizing usertesting.com or related services before we begin to get involved in developing it to see whether
        it appeals to your target market. Secondly, getting feedback during the prototype stage also be advantageous for making sure that our design approach is workable and for identifying
        compromises before coding starts. Since the development of a technology project took the most expensive part, our application is no different.   </p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Development</strong></p>
    <P>This is obviously the phase where almost all of the work happens. This stage will be the most time-consuming for the developers and a lot of requirements need to be taken into account while 
        custom-designing an app. Firstly, for back-end development, since any mobile application solution has a back end, this is a place where all the database, APIs, logic and other background stuff is stored.
        Back-end developers have the authority to control the content of our applications, users and notifications management. In general, backend development is the cornerstone of any application development.
        Secondly, we also want to upgrade our software with AI capabilities such as developing machine learning algorithms that assist user progress in the future based on their present behavior recorded in our
        product or smart assistant offering suggestions on customers to alter their eating routines for improved outcomes. Besides the back-end department, we also need to have front-end developers who design the
        UX/UI and improve the performance of the product for the customers.</P>
    <p><strong>Step 3: Testing</strong></p>
    <P>In order to ensure our app is operated efficiently and smoothly, testing it before releasing it to the public is very important. In this stage, we need to consider all the device specifications like different
        screen sizes, OS (operating system) variations and flavors that our program needs to support. Also, think about every difficult scenario that might occur when users engage with the app. For this reason, we need
        to assign this phase to experts who are capable of running many sorts of tests on several devices simultaneously which assist identify errors even during the development phase since they have access to specialized testing platforms.  </P>
    <p><strong>Step 4: Release</strong></p>
    <P> Once we've completed the testing and made sure the app is working properly, we'll apply for approval for the software to be released on the app marketplaces of different platforms such as Google Play and App Store.
        Additionally, we will need to convert the server to a live environment after stress-testing it earlier. When having our applications accepted into these markets, the customers can download our product and use it,
        we can begin marketing to expand the users.  </P>
    <p><strong>Step 5: Maintenance and Upadate</strong></p>
    <P>After making our app available to the general public, we need to monitor a lot of things to maintain the app’s performance as best as possible. We need to track what our potential clients are and the number of people sticking with our app.
        From that, we can adjust and support our customers to get a great experience when using the app. In addition to monitoring app data, we must prepare for future updates and features to support the most recent iOS and Android features.
        Lastly, even after going through testing, it is inevitable to encounter some weird and strange problems and bugs on certain devices, therefore we need to troubleshoot any bugs that arise making the app less enjoyable for the users.  </P>
    <p>Since half of the team members are first-year students in IT and the others remaining are undergraduates in robotics and mechatronics major, we lack the necessary knowledge, appropriate skills and experiences to complete the project.
        In specific, the back-end development of our software requires developers that have many years of experience in the industry and understand APIs and stuff deeply to work with such a large food database, which is the dead-end in our progress at the moment.
        Additionally, this kind of technology project demands a lot of resources such as time, money and people, which is also a big limitation for 4 members team who are still students and still have to study at university like us so we cannot invest and focus fully on this project. </p>
    <P> For the current progress of the project, since most members are first-year students and we have a limited amount of time, our team can only make the presentation to advertise the application and illustrate any formation related to our project. </P>

    <!--Scope and Limits-->
    <h2>5. Scope and Limits</h2>
    <p>Here is the list of tasks that need to be done to complete our project:</p>
    <p>-	Make a database for storing the information of the customers (their age, weight and preference including their allergy to specific foods, vegetarian, etc.).</p>
    <p>-	Build a database that has various receipts with different values of calories.</p>
    <p>-	Create a feature allowing the user to input the names of ingredients by text.</p>
    <p>-	Scanning function that allows the customer to scan all the ingredients by using the camera on the phone.</p>
    <p>-	Train an AI model with the capability to recommend a suitable food portion based on user weight and a list of recommended receipts based on user preference (based on their ingredient and their frequency in the selection of food).</p>
    <p>-	The “Remind” feature will remind the customer about the leftover in the fridge when the user inputs the food and its due date.</p>
    <p>-	The “Switch User” feature allows the app to have many users on 1 smartphone.</p>
    <p>-	Build the User Interface (UI) for the application.</p>
    <p>-	Build an Android app and develop another version on the IOS platform (cross-platform development).</p>
    <p>-	Build the website.</p>
    <p>Based on the remaining time of this semester, the most important task is to finish building the website for the report and doing the presentation 
        for our project idea. About the app itself or any features, in our opinion, with the remaining time and the limited knowledge in programming applications 
        as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), we cannot build any functions of the application or the database as well as train the AI model. 
        If the time duration is extended, our team could work more on the project such as building the UI of the application and developing the algorithm to help 
        with the food recognition function to identify the ingredient in the picture. For the use of AI in the project, to reduce the budget and increase the performance
        of the app, instead of using AI to calculate the calories and recommend the receipts, we may build a database and use an algorithm to calculate the calories 
        and recommend the meal for the user.</p>

    <h2>9. Risks</h2>
    
    <!--Group communications-->
    <h2>10. Group communications</h2>
    <p>Our team communicates daily through Messenger and weekly meetings will take place on Microsoft Team. If a member cannot be communicated with, 
        we will give that member 24 hours to provide a justified reason, which will be decided by the group leader based on the importance of the task 
        and its impact on the possible delay of the project. If the consequence is not serious, that member will be consulted and have an agreement on 
        the communication guidelines of the team. On the other hand, if the consequence is serious or the situation keeps happening many times, that member
         will be considered to have a negative contribution to the project and report to the management team (lecturer and course coordinator in this case).</p>
    
    <!--Skills and Jobs-->
    <h1>IV. Skills and Jobs</h1>
    <p>The followings are the required skillsets and position description in order to complete the project:</p>
    <p>- <strong>Position 1:</strong> Software Engineer, who has experience in working with programming languages such as Python, 
        doing projects related to image recognition, working with big data and developing the AI model to handle the database. 
        Additionally, the engineer has the responsibility of troubleshooting and upgrading the existing AI model.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Position 2:</strong> Software Engineer, who is familiar with working with AI models and integrating AI into the application. 
        Similar to the first position, the engineer has the responsibility of troubleshooting and upgrading the existing AI model.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Position 3:</strong> Full-stack Developer (Backend) having a skill set in app programming and in charge of maintaining servers. 
        Moreover, this position needs to maintain and debug the backend of the application.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Position 4:</strong> Full-stack Developer (Frontend) working with UI of the app (cross-platform for both IOS and Android) and the website. 
        This position also needs to work with the business partners (shareholders) of the project.</p>
    <p>All the mentioned positions are the most important skill sets that we need to finish our project. Besides all the mentioned skill sets, 
        every member of the team should have good communication skills, teamwork experience and problem-solving skills. Finally, all of them need to have 
        great time management skills, be able to adapt to the change in the working process and willing to learn about new things.</p>

    <!--Group Reflection-->
    <h1>V. Group Reflection</h1>
    <p><strong>Student 1:</strong> Nguyen Quoc Binh</p>
    <p>In my opinion, each member of our group has a good mindset in finishing their part on time. Moreover, they are also willing to rewrite their part to 
        meet the standard of the group if there is good advice from other members. Every member understands their responsibility while working as a team, 
        which allowed the team to work well with individual contributions in developing ideas, sharing group activities, helping other members, and having a 
        wide range of skillset in many areas. The only thing that our team needs to improve is the frequency of communication in the group. Every member should 
        be more active in sharing their opinions instead of waiting to be asked since the lack of communication leads to unexpected errors in writing reports and 
        misunderstandings about the expected outcomes of the project. As the most surprising thing, I have to say that the team performance is better than my 
        expectation since this is the first time we cooperate working on a project. Finally, one thing that I have learned about working as a group is to achieve 
        the best result, I need to have more trust in other teammates and every member needs to help each other and share their opinion to get a good teamwork experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Student 2:</strong> Tran Manh Hung</p>
    <p> From my perspective, everyone on my team is very easy to cooperate with and has great teamwork during the semester. Each individual has their own strengths and weakness,
        and always acknowledges the need for change when getting recommendations from other members. In specific, Binh – our team leader is very good at managing all the work and
        always give good suggestion to all the members, Tam and Kiet who although just study the first semester in university, have great writing skill and always seek advice for better performance.
        Everyone is very responsible for completing their tasks before the deadline, which makes our teamwork extremely effective. The team atmosphere is also good, which helps
        individuals to perform better in their work and improve productivity, and creativity. However, there is a limitation existing in our teamwork, that is the communication between each member.
        Despite each member making great progress on their work, we rarely communicate with each other to update closely on the progress resulting in some misunderstandings in the outcome.
        Overall, the team's performance is outstanding though this is the first time that everyone has worked together. For me, I have also learned a lot from others and improved my soft skills through this project,
        I am also aware of myself having faith in teammates and always ready to support them when they meet difficulties. </p>
