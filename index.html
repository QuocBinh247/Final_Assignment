    <!--Project Description-->
    <h1>III. Project Description</h1>
    <!--Overview-->
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Topic:</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our group's goal is to create an app that will help users reducing food waste by suggesting different solutions. People nowadays don't
        have much time to care about their physical health and global warming has been a hot topic in recent years, besides reducing food waste
        and increasing people's healthy lifestyle, the app also helps to reduce environmental pollution. 

        Beside the main function of our app, we also aim to achieve a variety of minor benefits. We want to create a platform to help people
        better control and monitor their diet, such as by showing the calories of the food, the ingredients in each meal, planning a suitable 
        amount of food for purchasing, and receiving notifications when the ingredients (or leftovers) is about to expire. As a result, we can
        save money, reduce food waste, raise public awareness about the importance of food and protect the environment by reducing organic waste. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>
    <p>
        After researching the consequence of food waste and its impact on the finances and the environment in Vietnam, our team realizes that we need
        to do something to change the current situation. Basically, despite being a developing country, the amount of food waste in Vietnam is huge
        (compared to other developing countries) and affects the development of the country (losing about 3.9 billion USD in GDP per year) [1].
        Wasting food creates many problems such as pollution (both in producing and discarding the food). In our opinion, those wasted foods instead
        of being wasted can be used to provide support for people who are in poverty and donate to help many orphanages. 

        Moreover, we want to help people to have a healthier lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle is also a trend in many countries in the world at this
        moment, however, it is not considered as important in many developing countries such as Vietnam despite we already have a relatively healthy
        food portion compared to countries like the US. To our knowledge, many Vietnamese (especially young people) love eating fast foods and drinking
        Coke, which is unhealthy and can lead to diabetes. On the other hand, the quality of food in Vietnam is a concern since many people have
        illnesses such as cancer or many serious diseases due to the lack of regulation in manufacturing foods. Due to those reasons, it is better
        to cook your own meal and select the organic ingredients. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Landscape:</strong></p>
    <p>
        This is not a new concept on the platform; there are some pioneer apps with similar ideas, such as Too Good To Go, NoWaste, OLIO, Kitche, and
        Misfits Market. These apps all have the same purpose: to manage the leftover food in our homes and to keep track of our bodies' calories. 
        The difference is that all these apps always try to sell the remaining foods rather than find other ways to deal with them. However, 
        because people in Vietnam do not want to eat "leftover" food, these apps may not work well in countries like Vietnam. So, rather than trying
        to sell or trade these foods, we decided to process them sooner or reduce our ability to buy too much food 
    </p>

    <!--Aims-->
    <h2>2. Aims</h2>
    <p><strong>Project aim:</strong></p>
    <p>
        The primary goal of our group is to reduce food waste in Vietnam. With over 8,000,000 tons of food wasted each year, Vietnam currently ranks
        second in Asia-Pacific in terms of food waste. Vietnam has twice the rate of food waste as other advanced and wealthy economies around 
        the world [1]. These figures do not stop there but will continue to rise in the future. As a result, this app’s top priority is to reduce
        the amount of waste trash to the environment, allowing us to protect the environment at a time when global warming is becoming an important
        concern on the planet. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our first goal is to create the proper food portion. We will design a fit meal schedule for them in daily or weekly increments based on the
        customer's weight based on the information they provided previously and the ingredients that have been scanned. Then, based on their personal
        desires, such as being skinnier, gaining muscle, or improving health and disease prevention, we will provide them with a variety of foods
        and beverages based on the ingredients in the refrigerator. As a result, users can easily track calories in and out of their bodies every
        single day or meal, as well as avoid becoming bored with food; conversely, the app will help to encourage people to eat more for some people
        who are stuck in anorexia problems. 

        We live in the technology industry, where everything is growing at a rapid pace, from business, technology, healthcare and lifestyle.
        Also, because we had too many things to remember, we used to forget what we bought for our house. As a result, they tend to buy similar
        items that are duplicated with the ingredients in the refrigerator at home, which means they will have a large amount of the same food and
        will throw it away if it expires. In order to solve those issues, our app has a function to avoid overspending on food and reduce the amount
        of food waste. This function will tell us exactly the amount of food (leftovers) in the refrigerator and remind us of the food's near expiration
        date so we can use it quickly. Basically, it will provide an appropriate list of necessary food that the user needs to buy and a list of 
        existing food, which will reduce the amount of waste food created by overspending on food. 

        Designing healthy menus is an advantage of our app. People prefer eating fast food to eating healthy food or cooking at home. According to a recent
        Decision Lab poll of 16,000 residents (Generation Z) in Vietnam's three largest cities consists of Hanoi, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City, which
        accounts for 15% of a population of roughly 93 million, spend on average 890,000 VND ($40) per month on eating out [3]. The cost of $40 may seem
        insignificant to a foreigner, but it appears to be significant to many Vietnamese. To help citizens live healthier lives, we decided to include a
        feature that checks the food's calories and ingredients. All we need to do is search for the name of the food, and we will conduct research on its
        sources, ingredients, and nutritional content. Furthermore, if users are considering what to eat for the next meal, we have a tool that will suggest
        healthy meals based on their preferences, ensuring that they will be provided with adequate nutrition and energy for the day. 
        
        Finally, we could help customers by making the process of making food simpler. On our app, you can find a wide range of food and beverage recipes from
        various cooks and chefs around the world. Furthermore, if you cannot imagine how to cook the dish, we provide links to tutorial videos on our app, which
        is very useful for beginners or those who want to learn to cook themselves. As a result, you gain more knowledge about cooking and save money instead of
        eating out. 

        In our opinion, the core feature of this app is the ability to scan the ingredients and provide the user with a suitable recipe according to the scanned 
        ingredients. Other features such as the ability to calculate the food portion suitable for the user's weight, the reminder schedule for leftovers in the 
        fridge and the data for tracing eating habits (AI) in one app can be eliminated if we only have enough time and resource for one of our goals.
    </p>

    <!--Plan and Progress-->
    <h2>3. Plan and Progress</h2>
    <p>
        Since food wastage is a widespread issue in many countries, particularly in Vietnam, managing food waste becomes a crucial problem.
        If success, it will result to increase our capacity to maintain our economy and environment and also help us have a healthy eating habit.
        Identifying that the problem needed appropriate measures to be solved, Binh - our team leader proposed a project to develop an application that allows
        users to reduce their food waste and manage their daily diet in a healthy way.In recent years, the mobile phone is an indispensable item for the majority
        of the population and Android is now used on millions of mobile devices in over 190 countries across the globe, making it the most widely used mobile platform [4].
        For that reason, we decided to develop an Android application using Android Studio in order to reach the majority of clients over the globe and will develop
        to cross-platform further in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our proposed approach, this project will handle two issues which are food waste and unhealthy diets by helping people build a unique recipe for their meal.
        We want to develop a relevant application that can provide and share sustainable recipes which make such food products delicious and safe to eat. The app will
        have a function to suggest the appropriate meal for the user with calories for their consumption through the scanned ingredient. There are several key features
        that will offer great value for the clients. Firstly, we expect our app's onboarding process to be as smooth as possible. We expect our app can be used right
        away without any registration and will offer further advanced features for the user to register through their familiar account such as Facebook, Google, etc.
        Our application will use questionnaires to collect data such as weight, cooking habits and lifestyle then automatically save these entered data even if the
        user not doing the registration. By doing so, we can gather a lot of data for future development to improve our app performance. Secondly, we want to create
        a feature where the user can submit their custom goals. The app will ask what is the main purpose that the customers try to achieve besides the pre-defined
        options. There are several typical objectives such as maintaining a healthy weight, sticking to a strict diet. This data on the achievements of the existing 
        client will also be gathered for our product update afterward. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The next feature which also is the core function of our app is nutrition data input. By integrating with extensive food databases and based on the information
        of user’s favorite and recent meals, the app has the ability to calculate the calories that need to be consumed and allow the user to access the nutritional
        information as well as the expiration date of the ingredient, suggest the user the suitable recipe or create their own custom. Besides, our team wants to
        develop a feature to scan the ingredients through the camera, however, this took a lot of effort and study on the vision algorithm to implement successfully.
        When the user put all the ingredients in one place and uses the app to scan at that location, the screen will appear the relevant information
        of these ingredients regarding names and calories. We plan to develop a feature with an AI model to track the user's daily calories intake, then suggest
        reasonable meals based on the user’s health condition like weight, disease, etc with the nutritional value of the recommended dish demonstrated
        in the picture below: 
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img1.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Example of illustration of the dish. [5] "></p> 
    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 3: Example of illustration of the dish. [5]</p>
    <p>
        Besides, we expect our app to include meal planning functionality which allows users to schedule meals using leftovers in the fridge before they expire.
        The user first will input relevant information about the remaining resources in their fridge then the app should be able to provide versatile recipes with ingredient
        breakdowns to enable preparing the food based on the scanned ingredient for example. This feature will not only assist the clients to have more sufficient diets but 
        also lead to minimizing food wastage as much as possible. In addition, sometimes, users won't remember to access the app frequently because of their work or busy
        schedule, therefore, a notification feature will be essential for our app to encourage and remind our customers to stick to the plan and update their data often. Since we want to
        deliver the best experience for the users, in order to avoid the annoying of unnecessary notifications our app will have a section in the setting where clients can fine-grained
        customization of various notifications' kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our application requires an enormous number of databases such as web applications, nutrition and recipe databases. For our website application database, we want to connect our app
        to our website using MySQL to keep user data synchronized and accessible for other platforms. Regarding nutrition databases, it is a foundation of our application which provides it 
        with nutrition-related data namely calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Additionally, food databases make the program incredibly simple to use since the users do not need to
        input a lot of detailed information. The proposed application will use Nutritionix API since Nutritionix has a large validated nutrition database and provides several functionalities of the API suite. 
    </p>
    <p> For our plan, we will conduct this project in 5 steps:</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Prototyping</strong></p>
    <p>
        This is the stage that we are capable of implementing as students. The interactive prototype is a click-through version of a product that only exists in design, without coding development.
        There are several benefits of prototyping, one is that we are able to test it utilizing usertesting.com or related services before we begin to get involved in developing it to see whether
        it appeals to your target market. Secondly, getting feedback during the prototype stage also be advantageous for making sure that our design approach is workable and for identifying
        compromises before coding starts. Since the development of a technology project took the most expensive part, our application is no different.   
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Development</strong></p>
    <p>
        This is obviously the phase where almost all of the work happens. This stage will be the most time-consuming for the developers and a lot of requirements need to be taken into account while 
        custom-designing an app. Firstly, for back-end development, since any mobile application solution has a back end, this is a place where all the database, APIs, logic and other background stuff is stored.
        Back-end developers have the authority to control the content of our applications, users and notifications management. In general, backend development is the cornerstone of any application development.
        Secondly, we also want to upgrade our software with AI capabilities such as developing machine learning algorithms that assist user progress in the future based on their present behavior recorded in our
        product or smart assistant offering suggestions on customers to alter their eating routines for improved outcomes. Besides the back-end department, we also need to have front-end developers who design the
        UX/UI and improve the performance of the product for the customers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: Testing</strong></p>
    <p>
        In order to ensure our app is operated efficiently and smoothly, testing it before releasing it to the public is very important. In this stage, we need to consider all the device specifications like different
        screen sizes, OS (operating system) variations and flavors that our program needs to support. Also, think about every difficult scenario that might occur when users engage with the app. For this reason, we need
        to assign this phase to experts who are capable of running many sorts of tests on several devices simultaneously which assist identify errors even during the development phase since they have access to specialized testing platforms.  
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: Release</strong></p>
    <p> 
        Once we've completed the testing and made sure the app is working properly, we'll apply for approval for the software to be released on the app marketplaces of different platforms such as Google Play and App Store.
        Additionally, we will need to convert the server to a live environment after stress-testing it earlier. When having our applications accepted into these markets, the customers can download our product and use it,
        we can begin marketing to expand the users.  
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: Maintenance and Upadate</strong></p>
    <p>
        After making our app available to the general public, we need to monitor a lot of things to maintain the app’s performance as best as possible. We need to track what our potential clients are and the number of people sticking with our app.
        From that, we can adjust and support our customers to get a great experience when using the app. In addition to monitoring app data, we must prepare for future updates and features to support the most recent iOS and Android features.
        Lastly, even after going through testing, it is inevitable to encounter some weird and strange problems and bugs on certain devices, therefore we need to troubleshoot any bugs that arise making the app less enjoyable for the users.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Since half of the team members are first-year students in IT and the others remaining are undergraduates in robotics and mechatronics major, we lack the necessary knowledge, appropriate skills and experiences to complete the project.
        In specific, the back-end development of our software requires developers that have many years of experience in the industry and understand APIs and stuff deeply to work with such a large food database, which is the dead-end in our progress at the moment.
        Additionally, this kind of technology project demands a lot of resources such as time, money and people, which is also a big limitation for 4 members team who are still students and still have to study at university like us so we cannot invest and focus fully on this project. 
    </p>
    <p> For the current progress of the project, since most members are first-year students and we have a limited amount of time, 
        our team can only make the presentation to advertise the application and illustrate any formation related to our project. 
    </p>
    
    <!--Roles-->
    <h2>4. Roles</h2>
    <p>We have decided on the roles for each member of the team. The roles are defined by their background information and interest in that field. The paragraphs below will clarify the duty of each member and express how important they are to the success of this project.</p>
    <p><strong>Nguyen Quoc Binh: Lead Developer</strong></p>
    <p>
        - As he has stated in his personal information, Nguyen Quoc Binh is in the final year of the Robotic program, and he also has years of experience in doing projects. With his deep knowledge of technology and teamwork skills, he has been trusted to hold the position of Leader Developer. 
        Binh’s main duty is coordinating the tasks of the team. He is the person responsible for making appointments to discuss ideas between members. He also maps out the plan for finishing the tasks. 
        To be more specific, he analyzes the project demands and then draws the timeline with tasks equally and suitably assigned for each member. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Tran Manh Hung: Backend Developer (AI)</strong></p>
    <p>
        - Similar to our Leader Developer, Tran Manh Hung is also in the final year of the Robotic program. The different point is he has knowledge of AI since he has spent years researching this field. Along with his coding skills, Tran Manh Hung is assigned to the Backend Developer position. 
        In other words, he is in charge of developing AI and training machines for our application. To be more specific, he has to write mathematical algorithms for AI and train our application to recognize all the food types. Then, the application can suggest healthy meals that make full use of the customer’s food.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Dang Minh Tam: User Interface Designer and Frontend Developer</strong></p>
    <p>
        - Dang Minh Tam is a first-year student in the Information Technology course. He has intermediate coding skills which are suitable for holding the position of User Interface and Frontend Developer. In this role, he has to take responsibility for creating the interface for our application and its advertising website. 
        He has to guarantee that the design is captivating, and the features are user-friendly. This step is necessary to draw target customers to our project. Without his effort in Interface design, the project will lose its target customers because they find the application and advertising website unsightly and difficult to use. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Pham Tuan Kiet: Full-stack Developer</strong></p>
    <p>
        - Similar to Dang Minh Tam, Pham Tuan Kiet is also in his first year of an Information Technology course. He has nurtured the love of technology for years. Additionally, He also took his first coding subject in semester 1 and several online courses about Python on Codecademy. With his keen interest and coding expertise, Full-stack Developer is the right position for him. 
        In this role, he has to work on two sides of the application and websites: the backend and the front end. For the former, he needs to collaborate with Tran Manh Hung, our backend developer of AI, to support him in the process of creating logic for developing and training the AI model. For the latter, Pham Tuan Kiet needs to aid Dang Minh Tam in implementing and designing the architecture for our application and website.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Final statement:</strong></p>
    <p>- Every role in this project is equally important. The participation of each member is indispensable, and the project cannot run without their restless effort.</p>

    <!--Scope and Limits-->
    <h2>5. Scope and Limits</h2>
    <p>Here is the list of tasks that need to be done to complete our project:</p>
    <p>- Make a database for storing the information of the customers (their age, weight and preference including their allergy to specific foods, vegetarian, etc.).</p>
    <p>- Build a database that has various receipts with different values of calories.</p>
    <p>- Create a feature allowing the user to input the names of ingredients by text.</p>
    <p>- Scanning function that allows the customer to scan all the ingredients by using the camera on the phone.</p>
    <p>- Train an AI model with the capability to recommend a suitable food portion based on user weight and a list of recommended receipts based on user preference (based on their ingredient and their frequency in the selection of food).</p>
    <p>- The “Remind” feature will remind the customer about the leftover in the fridge when the user inputs the food and its due date.</p>
    <p>- The “Switch User” feature allows the app to have many users on 1 smartphone.</p>
    <p>- Build the User Interface (UI) for the application.</p>
    <p>- Build an Android app and develop another version on the IOS platform (cross-platform development).</p>
    <p>- Build the website.</p>
    <p>
        Based on the remaining time of this semester, the most important task is to finish building the website for the report and doing the presentation 
        for our project idea. About the app itself or any features, in our opinion, with the remaining time and the limited knowledge in programming applications 
        as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), we cannot build any functions of the application or the database as well as train the AI model. 
        If the time duration is extended, our team could work more on the project such as building the UI of the application and developing the algorithm to help 
        with the food recognition function to identify the ingredient in the picture. For the use of AI in the project, to reduce the budget and increase the performance
        of the app, instead of using AI to calculate the calories and recommend the receipts, we may build a database and use an algorithm to calculate the calories 
        and recommend the meal for the user.

            <td>Communication issues</td>
            <td>
                Two communication issues can affect our team's performance. The first problem is lacking time for group discussion. 
                Due to the limited time in tutorial class, our team have little time to talk with each other. Our tutorial lecture only 
                provides us 90 minutes for discussion weekly. Hence, our team has insufficient time to discuss the project’s stuff. 
                The second issue is the inexperience in group discussions. Pham Tuan Kiet and Dang Minh Tam are two first-year students 
                in our team who are new to working on university projects. This means they may not be as good at expressing ideas and 
                thoughts as others. This can lead to mutual misunderstanding causing working productivity to decrease.
            </td>
            <td>
                Our team created a group chat on social websites where our teammates can talk to each other about work. 
                Microsoft Team and Messenger are the two preferred social apps that we use for discussing outside the class. 
                This means we can make online appointments anytime without caring about the time limit. Having more time conversing with 
                others and discussing topics related to projects makes everyone deeply understand what they need to do and how they can 
                achieve it.  For the second issue, we encourage two first-year members to map out their ideas on paper in the form of 
                scripts or diagrams. In that way, their thoughts would be easier to comprehend.

                This risk is about the private information of users getting exposed to people with bad intentions. 
                The perpetrators could be hackers or core members. Hackers attack our website and application via vulnerabilities 
                of the security site. Core members secretly steal data from the project’s database. They use this private information 
                to sell it to other parties for money or damage the reputation of our project. Whichever the reason lying behind their 
                course of action is, the result is devastating and causes the customers to lose their trust in our products. 
            </td>
            <td>
                Backend and front-end developers have to collaborate to create apps and websites that have strong security. 
                To accomplish this, our developers need to upgrade our skills in cybersecurity. What is more, we also have to keep strict 
                track of members’ activities by equipping our products with a history tracking tool. This course of action is to prevent 
                core members from leaking private data of systems and users to the outside. Our team can also consider the third-party 
                option. This means we will hire other cyber security companies to protect our private information.

            <td>Bad recommendation of food portion (based on user’s weight)</td>
            <td>
                In this bug, the application cannot recommend a meal that suits the users’ weight. There are two potential causes behind
                this error. Firstly, the app cannot correctly recognize the food types. In other words, the recognizing system of the 
                application is broken due to the wrong algorithm applied. Hence, food types cannot be scanned and classified exactly by the
                app. Secondly, the intelligent machine of our app has problems with analyzing data input. To be more specific, the app fails 
                to choose proper food types to build meals that have total calories like recommended daily calorie intake of customers. 
                This causes the customers to gain more weight which does not meet the app’s guarantee for healthy meals. 
            </td>
            <td>
                There are two solutions to tackle this risk. For the first cause, we need to fix the recognition function to help our app 
                recognize the correct food types. This fixing process will last for at least two weeks until we make sure our application can 
                run well. The first thing we do is to identify and re-train the food types that our app cannot recognize from customers’ feedback. 
                After that, we will conduct the overall scanning bug by using our application to scan all food types. Any error in recognizing food 
                types that are detected in this scanning will be fixed by backend developers. For the second cause, we will need to find the errors 
                in the algorithm of AI. This course of action requires us to execute several test cases on building meals. We will choose meals 
                that have different calories compared to the suggested daily calorie intake. After locating the bugs in these meals, 
                backend developers will fix and test the app again to make sure the app can operate well without repeating that bug.

            <td>
                In this error, the application cannot execute the “remind” notifications to the user’s account. The core problem may be 
                caused by either the program or the interface of the app. In terms of the program, the codes that backend developers wrote 
                for it to perform the reminding order may be in problems. Perhaps they were careless in coding this order leading to 
                the app’s inability to send “remind” notifications to users’ accounts. In terms of the app’s interface, the app might send 
                the message to order the interface presenting the reminder to users’ accounts, but it did not work. There would be some bugs 
                in the interface that made the notifications could not be present.
            </td>
            <td>
                Both the debugging processes for the program and interface need at least 2 days until it is done. First, our team will launch 
                the overall scanning to navigate to the bugs. Then, our developers will engage in fixing the errors before conducting several 
                test cases to ensure that the application can operate well. If the problem comes from the program, backend developers need to 
                jump in to detect and fix it. This requires them to adjust the coding that they applied to the “remind” feature. If the problem 
                comes from the interface, front-end developers need to engage to fix this error. This requires them to check the codes they 
                have built to form the bond between the logical machine and the interface. Perhaps some bugs prevent the interface from 
                receiving messages from the logical machine.

                In this bug, the application repeats the receipts from past days within a week. The problem is mainly about the algorithm that 
                our backend developers applied for AI. All the algorithms must be carefully chosen and arranged to teach the app how to create 
                different receipts for customers. Our developers could make some mistakes in choosing the suitable algorithm for AI to produce 
                unique receipts. This results in repeating receipts for customers of the app. Customers might get bored with the repetitive meals 
                leading to quitting the app.  
            </td>
            <td>
                Backend developers need to change or adjust the algorithm of AI. This process will last for at least 7 days until it is done 
                depending on the sophistication of errors. First, our developers need to analyze the algorithms to figure out the unreasonable 
                points within them. We will conduct the analysis procedure to check the correction in choosing these algorithms and the way we 
                arrange them to train our AI model to offer different meals.  After detecting all the bugs, our developers will adjust the 
                algorithms and test the application to guarantee it can produce unique receipts for customers each day within a week.

            <td>
                This risk is about the difficulties in training AI. The biggest obstacle that discourages people from studying AI is its 
                sophisticated feature. The AI field is massive because there are lots of parts to master in AI. Hence, learning AI is undeniably 
                time-consuming and hard to do. To train an AI model, an AI engineer needs to spend at least 4 to 6 months learning the basic 
                knowledge of AI. Then, they must spend another 6-month applying their knowledge to just create simple AI models. Our application 
                requires us to create a slightly complicated AI model for automatically recommending meals that meet our mentioned criteria.  
            </td>
            <td>
                We have two solutions to mitigate this risk. Firstly, we encouraged our backend developers to start learning AI at the beginning 
                of the course. It is of great importance for our developers to discover AI before we conduct the project. This course of action 
                helps backend developers gain as much knowledge as they need for creating a simple AI model. In that process, we also prompt our 
                developers to seek additional AI documents for studying purposes. Having more sources to research is critically beneficial to their 
                AI study progress. Secondly, we also encourage our developers to consider consulting AI professionals. They can offer our team 
                constructive ideas in training AI models for our project.

                This risk is about some possible problems that our advertising website may have. There would be some bugs and errors that 
                prevent the website from running properly. For example, users cannot gain access to our website due to a bug that prevents 
                our website from giving users entrance authorization. Another instance would be customers getting in trouble clicking any 
                tab buttons on the website. They clicked but the website did not move them to another page. 
            </td>
            <td>
                Our team will conduct a debugging process that lasts for at least 2 days until it is done depending on the sophistication of 
                the bug. We will analyze the bug to know which part the bug comes from. Then, we will conduct the overall scanning to navigate 
                to the bugs. After detecting the bugs, Front end developers will figure out ways to fix them. This may require them to adjust 
                the codes they used for creating the structure of the interface. Before allowing customers to use it, our application needs 
                to be tested several times to guarantee it can run well without repeating that bug.

            <td>Bad optimization of the application</td>
            <td>
                This risk is about poorly optimized applications. To be more specific, we might focus too much on advancing our application, 
                but we forgot not to pay attention to how inefficiently it runs on the user’s device. There are a lot of consequences that a 
                poorly optimized app brings to users’ devices. A clear example would be an advanced application that will consume the massive 
                space of disk in the device of users. This leads to slow data processing or even temporary shutdown of the device. 
            </td>
            <td>
                Our solution is to reorganize our coding structure. We recognize that codes behind the logical machine play an important role 
                in how our app runs on the user’s device. For example, we can change the sorting function from the bubble sort to the merge sort. 
                Traditionally, bubble sort in the application can take up to 1,000,000 steps to sort the list of 1000 elements. It is not the case 
                for merger sort. This sorting type can execute the results 100 times faster with about 10,000 steps. This allows the application 
                not to take up large memory space and it also prevents the device from temporarily shutting down due to overloading data processing 
                of the app’s functions.

    <h2>10. Group communications</h2>
    <p>
        Our team communicates daily through Messenger and weekly meetings will take place on Microsoft Team. If a member cannot be communicated with, 
        we will give that member 24 hours to provide a justified reason, which will be decided by the group leader based on the importance of the task 
        and its impact on the possible delay of the project. If the consequence is not serious, that member will be consulted and have an agreement on 
        the communication guidelines of the team. On the other hand, if the consequence is serious or the situation keeps happening many times, that member
        will be considered to have a negative contribution to the project and report to the management team (lecturer and course coordinator in this case).

    <!--Group Reflection-->
    <h1>V. Group Reflection</h1>
    <p><strong>Student 1:</strong> Nguyen Quoc Binh</p>
    <p>
        In my opinion, each member of our group has a good mindset in finishing their part on time. Moreover, they are also willing to rewrite their part to 
        meet the standard of the group if there is good advice from other members. Every member understands their responsibility while working as a team, 
        which allowed the team to work well with individual contributions in developing ideas, sharing group activities, helping other members, and having a 
        wide range of skillset in many areas. The only thing that our team needs to improve is the frequency of communication in the group. Every member should 
        be more active in sharing their opinions instead of waiting to be asked since the lack of communication leads to unexpected errors in writing reports and 
        misunderstandings about the expected outcomes of the project. As the most surprising thing, I have to say that the team performance is better than my 
        expectation since this is the first time we cooperate working on a project. Finally, one thing that I have learned about working as a group is to achieve 
        the best result, I need to have more trust in other teammates and every member needs to help each other and share their opinion to get a good teamwork experience.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Student 2:</strong> Tran Manh Hung</p>
    <p> 
        From my perspective, everyone on my team is very easy to cooperate with and has great teamwork during the semester. Each individual has their own strengths and weakness,
        and always acknowledges the need for change when getting recommendations from other members. In specific, Binh – our team leader is very good at managing all the work and
        always give good suggestion to all the members, Tam and Kiet who although just study the first semester in university, have great writing skill and always seek advice for better performance.
        Everyone is very responsible for completing their tasks before the deadline, which makes our teamwork extremely effective. The team atmosphere is also good, which helps
        individuals to perform better in their work and improve productivity, and creativity. However, there is a limitation existing in our teamwork, that is the communication between each member.
        Despite each member making great progress on their work, we rarely communicate with each other to update closely on the progress resulting in some misunderstandings in the outcome.
        Overall, the team's performance is outstanding though this is the first time that everyone has worked together. For me, I have also learned a lot from others and improved my soft skills through this project,
        I am also aware of myself having faith in teammates and always ready to support them when they meet difficulties. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Student 3:</strong> Dang Minh Tam</p>
    <p>
        After completing this course, I have a new perspective on the world of information technology. I've gained a wealth of knowledge and experience about how an app works as well as the background
        of developing a website system. Aside from that, I have learned more soft skills in group performances, such as how to work with others and enhance their abilities.
        As a newcomer, I do not have much experience working as part of a team, but these guys have led me in the right direction and shown me every step of the team's projects.
        Binh, as a team leader, has demonstrated a reasonable and accurate plan for a team and has always suggested and guided me on what I am supposed to do in my role. Hung and Kiet, on the other
        hand, have done an excellent job as team members and have played a vital role in ensuring that we always meet deadlines on time. We don't have any offline meetings during the project because
        of our different school schedules. We constantly communicate via Messenger about any errors that need to be fixed or work division. Fortunately, we never have to struggle under any circumstances; 
        everyone consistently collaborates together and never misses deadlines. Finally, I have a much more understanding of this major and am more confident about my future steps on my path. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Student 4:</strong> Pham Tuan Kiet</p>
    <p>
        For this assignment, I performed pretty well. The only mistake that I made was missing the deadline for my first task in this group. I was so regretful of doing this because it slowed down the team’s working progress. 
        The project leader, Nguyen Quoc Binh, talked with me about my case. He gave me many words of encouragement which hoped me to recognize my shortcoming and pay more attention to the next assigned tasks. 
        Thanks to this incident, I have learned that I have to be more responsible with my words and the trust that other people have laid on my shoulders. After finishing this assignment, I recognize that there is still an aspect that our group needs to improve. 
        We should have more time to discuss things with each other. Discussion is critically important in a group project because it helps every member to deeply understand the project’s concepts and how they can execute their assigned tasks well. 
        The fact that surprises me a lot is that even though we lacked group discussions, every member still managed to finish the tasks on time. 
        The project went very smoothly without any major obstacles. From choosing ideas to assigning tasks to every member, there were no conflicts within my group. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Group:</strong></p>
    <p>
        In our opinion, our group worked well on Assignment 3. Overall, every member of our team understands their work and what they need 
        to do to finish the part. Moreover, we think our team is good at teamwork despite there being some miscommunications and misunderstandings
        during the work process in Assignment 2. This is because our team has members with experience in working on group projects and 
        the first-year members already have some knowledge of IT as well as the responsibility of finishing their tasks on time. 
        Additionally, every team member also tried their best and gave an effort in doing the group assignment, helped other members in 
        finishing their part, and expressed their idea on how to improve the quality of the assignment. After the group project and 
        Assignment 3 in this course, we can say that we have learned a lot about working as a team, collab with members who are not 
        familiar with each other and have more knowledge as well as study about the use of Git and HTML in the IT sector. 
        We knew how to use GitHub to share the project and collab with each other to finish the project and make sure that all members 
        are on the page. In addition, we learn about how to manage the time and flow of the project, share the workload, and communicate 
        with each other to keep track of the progress of the project. Finally, we studied many interesting topics such as AI, 
        programming languages, technologies (software and hardware), and work ethics during the research process for the project idea 
        to become an effective and good engineer, which we think will be helpful for our career in the future. If Assignment 3 could be 
        extended, every member should be more active in group communication about topics such as personal issues with their given part 
        and opinions about project ideas. In order to do that, our team needs to have at least 2 meetings per week to have better communication. 
        Moreover, the use of a Gantt chart for an estimated project timeline to control the flow of the project is necessary for checking each 
        member’s contribution and the current working progress of the project. Finally, every member needs to conduct more research about the tools 
        and technologies used in the project so that the project can be done and our team has better knowledge about these topics.
