    <h2>2. Personal Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Student 1:</strong> Nguyen Quoc Binh</p>
    <p>My name is Nguyen Quoc Binh (s3818140), I am an undergraduate student in the Robotics and Mechatronics major at RMIT University Vietnam. 
        I am enthusiastic about technologies such as computer science, automated systems, and artificial intelligence, which is the reason why I 
        selected this course since it offers knowledge in a wide range of technology areas. In addition, I also have prior experience with electrical design, 
        mechanical design, and embedded programming due to my work on several projects during the study period. My hobbies are traveling, reading, 
        watching movies (especially sci-fi and action movies), and playing video games in my free time.</p>

    <h2>10. Group communications</h2>
    <p>Our team communicates daily through Messenger and weekly meetings will take place on Microsoft Team. If a member cannot be communicated with, 
        we will give that member 24 hours to provide a justified reason, which will be decided by the group leader based on the importance of the task 
        and its impact on the possible delay of the project. If the consequence is not serious, that member will be consulted and have an agreement on 
        the communication guidelines of the team. On the other hand, if the consequence is serious or the situation keeps happening many times, that member
         will be considered to have a negative contribution to the project and report to the management team (lecturer and course coordinator in this case).</p>
